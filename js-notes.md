# JavaScript Notes:

**_Javascript_** is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a scrip.
If HTML is the content layer, CSS is the presentation layer, then _Javascript_ is the **behavior layer** 

## Important _Javascript_ Reminders.
1. It is best to keep _Javascript_ code in its own _Javascript_ file. You can write _Javascript_ as in line code into the html file but that practice is not widely used.
1. The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to loadthe _Javascript_ file.
1. _Javascript_ runs where it is found in the HTML.
1. _Javascript_ is case sensitive.
1. A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one by one. Each individual instruction or step is know as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
1. Each statement should start on a new line.
1. Equal Sign in _Javascript_ is called an **Assignment Operator.**
1. If a variable name is more then one word, it is usually written in **camelCase**. This means the first word is all lowercase and any subsequent words have their first letter capitalized.
1. _Javascript_ distinguishes between numbers, 'strings', and **true** or **false** values known as Booleans.
