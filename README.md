Today I will learn,
- markdown
- growth mindset
- sandbox learning

My definition of growth mindset:
> growth mindset is the idea that we are always learning and to take a optimistic outlook on your journey. You will fail at some point. But growth mindset alllows you the luxury of viewing that failure as only one stepping stone to your final destination. Get up, start walking, and enjoy your journey where ever that may take you. 

My 3 reminders for keeping myself in a growth mindset are:
- It is ok to walk away from it, take a break before coming back to work if I get stuck
- I will NOT get it right away, thats ok.
- Remember to ask for help, I am not alone in this!!!!
