**Computer Architecture and Logic**

 # _TAKE AWAYS FROM HOW COMPUTERS WORK PLAYLIST_

 Four things all computers have in common: _input_, _storage_, _processing_, and _output_.

 Binary number system is at the root of all code. The binary number system is made up of only the numbers 1 and 0. They are used to create a circuit. A computer is made up of millions of these circuits.  

 Computer Hardware equals:

- circuits 
- wires c
- chips 
- speakers 
- plugs
 
 And computer software equals all the code that is entered into the   hard ware. This could include:
 
 - APPS
 - games
 - websites
 - maps
 
  _Software tells the hardware what to due through the Central Processing unit or "CPU"_.

 Inside the _CPU_ is the **OS** or Operating System. It is this OS software that tells the computer how to use all other software installed on the computer.
