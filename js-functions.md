**What is a function?**

_Functions_ let you group a series of statements together to preform a specific task. If differant parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function rather then repeating the same set of statements.

**To create a function**

To create a function you give it a name/identifier and then write the statements needed to achive its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a _function declaration_.

**Calling a function**

Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is know as _calling the function_.

**Declaring functions that need information**

Sometimes a function needs specific information to preform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give it _parameters_,Inside the function, parameters act like variables. When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called _arguements_, and they can be provided as values or as variables.
