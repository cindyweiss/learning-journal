#  CSS Notes:

**CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheet
If HTML is the bones or structure of the page then CSS is the body of the page. It shows a prettier picture of the page. CSS adds all of your color and styling.

**Understanding Color**
* RGB Values - _Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255_
* Hex Codes - _Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code._
* Color Names - _Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number._
* Hue - _Hue is new to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue._
* Saturation - _Saturation refers to the amount of grey in a color. At a maximum saturation, there  would be no grey in the color. At a minimum saturation, the color would be mostly grey._
* Brightness - _Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in the color. At a maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At a minimum brightness, the color would be very dark._
