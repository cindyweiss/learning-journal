**Javascript Notes on Comparison Operators and Loops**

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a _Boolean_: TRUE or FALSE.

**Definitions of Operators**
_Found on pages 150-151 & 156-157_
1. '==' Is equal to: The operator compares two values to see if they are the same.
1. '!=' Is not equal to: The operator compares two values to see if they are NOT the same.
1. '>'  Is greater than: The operater checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
1. '<'  Is less than: The operater checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
1. '===' Strict equal to: The operator compares two values to check that both the data type AND value are the same.
1. '!==' Strict not equal to: he operator compares two values to check that both the data type AND value are _NOT_ the same.
1. '>=' Greater than or equal to: The operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.
1. '<=' Less than or equal to: The operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.
1. '||' Logical or: This operator tests at least one condition. If either expression evaluates to **True**, then the expression returns **True**. If both return **False**, then the expression will return **False**.
1. '&&' Logical and: The operator tests more than one condition. If _BOTH_ expressions evaluate to **True**      then the expression returns **True**. If just _one_ of these returns **False**, then the expression will return **False**.
1. '!'  Logical NOT: This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. This reverses the state of an expression. If it was **False** before the ! was added, then it would return **True**. If the statement was **True**, it would return **false**.
