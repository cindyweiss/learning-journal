# HTML in a nut shell

** What is html? ** 
Html is an easily accessible coding language used to create webpages. It provides the structure for the web page that you are designing. 

**Inside HTML**

+ Html code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets- these are called HTML _Elements_

+ Elements are usually made up of two _Tags_ : an opening tag and a closing tag

+ **The closing tag in HTML is differant then the opening tag** In order for the computer to know that you are done talking to it you have to give it a clue.... adding a forwardslash in front of your closing tag does just that

## **HTML tags and their descriptions**

_body element_ is everything shown inside the main browser window
_h1-h6 elements_ are headings, with 1 being the most prominent and 6 being the least prominent
_p element_ are at the begining and ending of paragraphs
_b element_ creates a line break since html does not normally acknowledge white space
_i element_ make characters appear italic
_strong element_ indicates strong importance and by default browsers will show contents of strong elements in bold
