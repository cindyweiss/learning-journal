# Git vs GitHub

Git is a version control software program used in code editing. 
It is **DVCS** system that allows multiple users to colaberate easily. Git also allows all versions of the code worked on to be saved so the differant itterations made along the way can be revisited and tracked. This is true for each developer working on the colaberation as well as the project as a whole. 

GitHub is the application or cloud where developers code drafts and final projects live. It is the way to share your code with others. It also acts as your safe keeping so if code is lost locally you will always have access to your code from the cloud. 


Important to note:
There are two types of version control that are used.

1. *Centralized Version Control System* or **CVCS**-This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, 
which can be accessed by various clients. 
1. *Distributed Version Control systems* or **DVCS**- This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.
